      <p class="intro">
        <!-- job description goes here: -->
        User Experience designers craft beautiful and functional interfaces for
        websites, apps and other software to make them easier for consumers to
        use. Their end product may be the interface, but there is a lot of
        thought and research to do that goes into it. Some UX designers have a narrow
        role, while others are more broad. This career brings together
        psychology and marketing, understanding of human/computer interaction
        and design as well as software architecture.

        <h3>Education and Training</h3>
        <p>
          Most employers prefer you to have post-secondary education. 2 and
          4-year colleges. You can earn a degree or certificate. Some employers
          look for designers who have a bachelor's degree. There's no specific
          training required for this career, but no matter your path, a strong
          design portfolio is a must.
        </p>

      <section id="earnings">
        <h3>Earnings</h3>

          $125,000 per year. This would depend on the location and experience of
          the designer.

        <h3>Future Growth and Demands</h3>
        <p>
          Overall employment of web developers and digital designers is
          projected to grow 23 percent from 2021 to 2031, much faster than the
          average for all occupations.
        </p>
        <p>
          About 21,800 openings for web developers and digital designers are
          projected each year, on average, over the decade. Many of those
          openings are expected to result from the need to replace workers who
          transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force, such as to
          retire. (Bureau of Labor Statistics)
