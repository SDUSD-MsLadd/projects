        <h3>Future Growth and Demands</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- place as many paragraphs as you need in this section -->
          Employment of automotive service technicians and mechanics is projected to show little or no change from 2021 to 2031.

Despite limited employment growth, about 73,300 openings for automotive service technicians and mechanics are projected each year, on average, over the decade. Most of those openings are expected to result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force, such as to retire.
