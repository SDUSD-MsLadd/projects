        Nurses play a role in keeping people healthy. They assist patients who are ill or injured and they help doctors treat them. They also provide information about nutrition and exercise. Nurses combine a passion for medicine and helping and caring for others in their jobs everyday. The most well known types of nurses are registered nurses or RNs. They need more education than practical nurses. As a result they often take on a wider range of tasks.

            <p>I chose this career because I care a lot about peoples health and always believed in helping them. Ever since I was a little girl, I loved playing doctor with my dolls pretending they were my patients. As I grew up my mom noticed that I didn't get disgusted by blood or deep cuts. She always asked me what I wanna do when Im older and I always say a nurse because I like making people feel better when their hurt or ill. She told me it's good that I wanna be a nurse because I know how to deal with severe problems and health. </p>
