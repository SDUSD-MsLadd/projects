      <p class="intro">
        <!-- job description goes here: -->
        <p>Was the suspect's clothing splattered or sprayed with blood?Does the victim's dog hair match the dog of the suspect? Forensic scientists try to find answers to questions like these. They study and examine proof in labs. Then, in court, they present their findings. The justice system relies heavily on these scientists. They may be required to testify in court if a case goes to trial.</p>

<p>The application of science to the law is forensic science.I n this field, scientists play two main roles. One way to do this is to look at and compare evidence from victims, suspects, objects, and places. The other option is to call in an expert witness. This is what they do in court.</p>

<p>Police and investigators at the scene of a crime provide forensic scientists with their evidence. They occasionally refer to special-information-rich books and journals. They must locate relevant facts to the case they are studying.</p>

<p>Some of these scientists are generalists, many concentrate on a single field. Some of them work in toxicology and drugs. Blood and bodily fluids are examined for alcohol, drugs, or poison traces. To find a match, they might have to compare the DNA of a suspect to the DNA found at the crime scene.</p>


<p>Document analysis is the work of other scientists. They search for indications of fake documents. People who work in the field of firearms examine guns, cartridges, and bullets. Some are specialists in science. They are able to identify the accelerants that were used by an arsonist to start a fire.</p>

        <h3>Education and Training</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- place as many paragraphs as you need in this section -->
          <p>You can begin preparing for a career as a forensic scientist in high school. By taking courses in advanced math and science. A bachelor's degree in science that lasts at least four years is next. A master's degree is preferred by some employers </p>
           
         <p> A bachelor's degree in forensic science is offered by numerous colleges all over the country. Forensic science concentrations are also offered by some colleges in the field of science. Traditional degrees are used by many people to enter the field.You can study chemistry, biology, or a related field if you go this route.</p>
  
         <p>Master's degrees in forensic science are also offered by many colleges. Programs in chemistry and biology are available at almost all colleges. You may frequently be able to specialize in DNA analysis or toxicology through these programs. Additionally, PhD programs in forensic science are available in limited numbers. Also usually when you are hired, you typically receive additional on-the-job training.</p>

        <h3>Earnings</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- place as many paragraphs as you need in this section -->
          <p>The majority of forensic scientists have a single full-time job. The annual earnings of those just starting out can be somewhere from $35,000 to $45,000. They can earn $50,000 to $85,000 annually with a few years of experience. Managers and directors can earn more than $100,000 per year.</p>
          
          <p>The highest salaries are typically paid to those who work for federal government agencies. For instance, a scientist employed by the FBI is likely to earn more than one employed by a private laboratory. Benefits are typically available to forensic scientists who work full-time for large private organizations and the government. These can incorporate wellbeing inclusion and a retirement plan. Sick leave and vacation pay are also common.</p>

            <h4>Why I like this career</h4>
            <p>I like this career because I've always been intrested in criminology or simply being a first responder/rescuer. I've always thought of being for example a CSI,  Police Officer,  Paramedic, join the army or marines but I decided to be a Forensic scientist because I notice that since I was little I always liked playing solve crimes, puzzels and I'm not easiely grossed out by crime scenes since I've always being into those types of things. Also I've always liked science doing expirements and always would ask for puzzles crime games or science toys but ofcource I also played with other toys. So I've always been intrested in being a CSI or Forensic Scientist. Although i want to try to be also a CSI. </p>
