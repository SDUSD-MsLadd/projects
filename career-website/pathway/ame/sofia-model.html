      <p class="intro">
        Models help promote products and services in a wide range of places. Companies hire models to advertise their products on TV,  magazines, and conventions. There are many different type of models, some even work as posers for artists and sculptures. Models don't have to be a specific requirement unless asked for, they're all different and unique. Modeling takes a lot of confidence and understanding, each person has their own charm that models use to model. Some models just simply dress up and elegantly walk down a runaway, it involves a lot of strength and confidence. Modeling also requires a lot of recognition. After being asked around to be used as a model, you gain recognition, therefore that helps you gain so much more experience.

Depending on your model work, it's important to learn more than one language since models often travel around and end up in places.

        <p>
          The demand for this career is declining, it employs a smaller amount of people and its growth rate is slower than the national growth for all careers. Most of its growth is due on promotion and recognition. Your task as a model would be to gain experience starting from being a model student to something higher.

            <p>I chose this career because I am a model. I gained interest at 4 years old and started my first ever pageant show called "mis chiquitita 2012" and continued til today. I have traveled through the world, attented recignition and was a modeling student later on a national model. Modeling ruined my mental health at a really young age, since its a big stressful thing. Once you had went through all the stages of modeling, you will eventually get used to it and wokr your way through, which is my progress right now, modeling has so many difficulties. Even though modeling sounds though and hard, on the outside, Modeling is fun. You travel through worlds, meet alot of people, you gain many stuff while being a model, such as recognition and much experience. A professional model would know how to deal with it all,the goal is to try your best to keep growing and learning. I like this career because it reflects on my childhood and what i did for a living, my parents always supported me aswell, it bring me alot of memories, good ones. </p>
