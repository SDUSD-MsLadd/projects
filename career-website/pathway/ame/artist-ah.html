    <p class="intro">
      Using art, artist can use art just to express anything theyre feeling. Their are many different types of tools
      that different artists work with like sculptors work with 3d material like clay, stone, and wood, illustrators use
      pencils, charcoal, and many other materials, painters paint with paint. The subject for an artist can be anything,
      if its outside, animals, people, and many other things. Whatever an artist can use as inspiration just to create
      something, thats what being an artist is mostly about, being creative just to make anything that can inspire
      someone into making something or using other things as inspiration just to create something that you can call
      yours. "

    <section id="education">
      <h3>Education and Training</h3>
      <p>No formal training is really required for artist, their are all types of art programs that teach and guide
        others into becoming an artist, some art programs teach about the history of art, techniques, and types of art.
        There is also colleges and schools that offer degrees in art and programs. No training is needed to become an
        artist, programs give you an opportunity to make a portfolio of all your work you have done that is your best
        work, to give you a better chance into getting hired/getting a job.
      </p>
      <section id="earnings">
        <h3>Earnings</h3>
        <p>
          According to Xello, being self-employed as an artist can really depend on how much you can make, because you
          only make money if someone purchases your art. Artists who find salaried positions usually earn between
          $19,000 and $126,000 a year. The median income is $61,000 a year. Their income can depend on many things, such
          as the economy. Other factors include how popular their work is and the type of people who buy their art.

        <p>
          Most artists are self-employed. They work when they feel inspired and have time between their other
          commitments. These commitments are often other part-time jobs, including teaching art. No two days in a row
          are ever the same for artists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Established artists often work for a long time on a project. When they finish, they may take a break to come
          up with new, creative ideas for their next work of art. Struggling artists may not be able to take these kinds
          of breaks. One thing all artists have in common is a desire to work on their art. They work long, irregular
          hours to complete it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Artists usually work in a studio in a commercial building, or in their home. Studio spaces should be large and
          airy to reduce the risk of exposure to various fumes.

        <h3>Future Growth and Demands</h3>
        <p>
          The demand for this career is stable. The career employs a moderate number of people compared with other
          careers. But, its growth rate is slower than the national average growth for all careers.
        </p>
        <p>
          About 95,400 thousand openings for arts and design occupations are projected each year, on average. In
          addition to new jobs from growth, opportunities arise from the need to replace workers who leave their
          occupations permanently. <br>
