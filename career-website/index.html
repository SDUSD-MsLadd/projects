          The career web pages you will find in this site were produced by our Computer Science Discoveries class. The purpose of the project was to have each student learn about themselves and their interests in order to explore the idea of a specific career of their choosing. The individual web pages show the student's research and some insight on their choices.
        </p>
        <p>
          So much of our adult life is taken up with work, some of which we choose and some of which we luck into. By knowing more about themselves through the Xello career exploration questionaires, students are better to make initial exploratory choices about where they may want to take their lives. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Through the questionaires in Xello, students learn about their interests, their skills and personality traits. Xello matches up each individual with several different careers basing the suggestions on what the student expressed interest in and where their personalities and learning styles match up.
