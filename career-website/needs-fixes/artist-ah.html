          <p>Using art, artist can use art just to express anything theyre feeling. Their are many different types of tools that different artists work with like sculptors work with 3d material like clay, stone, and wood, illustrators use pencils, charcoal, and many other materials, painters paint with paint. The subject for an artist can be anything, if its outside, animals, people, and many other things. Whatever an artist can use as inspiration just to create something, thats what being an artist is mostly about, being creative just to make anything that can inspire someone into making something or using other things as inspiration just to create something that you can call yours.

          According to Xello, being self-employed as an artist can really depend on how much you can make, because you only make money if someone purchases your art. Artists who find salaried positions usually earn between $19,000 and $126,000 a year. The median income is $61,000 a year. Their income can depend on many things, such as the economy. Other factors include how popular their work is and the type of people who buy their art.

          <a href="Overall employment in arts and design occupations is projected to grow 2 percent from 2021 to 2031, slower than the average for all occupations.

          About 95,400 thousand openings for arts and design occupations are projected each year, on average. In addition to new jobs from growth, opportunities arise from the need to replace workers who leave their occupations permanently.
