        <h3>Future Growth and Demands</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- place as many paragraphs as you need in this section -->
          Employment of public safety telecommunicators is projected to grow 4 percent from 2021 to 2031, about as fast as the average for all occupations. About 10,900 openings for public safety telecommunicators are projected each year, on average, over the decade. Many of those openings are expected to result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force, such as to retire.

            <h4>Why I like this career</h4>
            <p> The reason why I have interest in being a dispatcher is because to me it seems like a good fit for me cause i want to help people when i'm older, i'm a fast typer and i feel like it provides lots of benefits like (dental, health, money/credit etc). Also, to me it seems like a good way to help people without putting yourself in danger everyday. I understand that this can be a fast-paced and challenging work environment, but I'm willing to meet those challenges.</p>
